# Default behaviour is to run all journeys. If that is not what you need you can specify the list of journeys to run
#   journeysToRun = [
#     hello-world-1,
#     hello-world-3
#   ]

# You can specify the same list of journeys via environment variables:
# journeysToRun.0 = hello-world-1
# journeysToRun.1 = hello-world-3
