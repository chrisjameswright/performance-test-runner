# The test have
# 1. an inital ramp up phase,
# 2. a usually longer phase with a constant rate and
# 3. a final ramp down phase

# The load percentage allows to specify at what percentage of the load set in the journey (journeys.conf) this test has to run.
# Examples:
# 1. if the journey load is 10 jps and the load_percentage is 60, the test will run at 6 jps
# 2. if the journey load is 10 jps and the load_percentage is 150, the test will run at 15 jps
