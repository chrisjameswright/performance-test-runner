// Include this in your application.conf file

// This overrides the 'baseUrl' for some of the most common microservices.
// Include this file in application.conf to run the test in your local environment
// where all frontends are hosted on localhost with different ports.

// If the service name you are searching is found, baseUrl is overridden.
// For local development convenience, host and protocol will have the following defaults:
//      protocol = http
//      host = localhost

// Example 1: (the base url for helloworld-service is https://127.0.0.1:9000)
// helloworld-service {
//      protocol = https
//      host = 127.0.0.1
//      port = 9000
// }

// Example 2: (the base url for helloworld-service is http://localhost:9000)
// helloworld-service.port = 9000


services {

  helloworld-service.port = 9000

}
